## Code Challenge for Full Stack Engineer (Job 7792)

Build a fullstack app for managing salon appointments.
This challenge evaluates your proficiency in both frontend and backend development, focusing on GraphQL, PostgreSQL, React, and TypeScript.

### Backend

GraphQL API: Implement a GraphQL API that supports the following operations:

- [x] salons with fields: id, name, location.
- [x] services with fields: id, salon_id, name, price.
- [x] appointments with fields: id, salonId, customerName, serviceName, appointmentTime.

Environment:
Use any Node.js framework (e.g., Express, Nest) to set up your GraphQL server.
